This section contains the instructions for some of them.

.. code-block:: vim

    Plug 'AntoineGagne/perfect-language-vim'

Usage
=====

Compiling, Verifying and Checking
---------------------------------

This plugin sets the ``makeprg`` variable.
This means you can simply use ``:make`` and it will automatically build, verify
and check the current file.
This also means that you can use the QuickFix list to quickly jump to errors
thrown at the compilation.

Build Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the output of these checks will be in the ``build`` folder.
You can configure this by setting the value of the variable
``g:perfect_build_output_directory``.

Builtin Declarations File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin uses ``/opt/escher/verificationstudio6/builtin/builtin.pdc`` as the
default file path to the *builtin* declarations.
You can configure this with the ``g:perfect_builtin_file_path`` variable.

Prover Rules Declarations File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin uses ``/opt/escher/verificationstudio6/builtin/rubric.pdc`` as the
default file path to the prover rules declaration.
You can configure this with the ``g:perfect_prover_rule_declaration_file_path``
variable.
